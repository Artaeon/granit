## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Task manager rewrite** — 6 views (Today, Upcoming, All, Done, Calendar, Kanban board), 5 priority levels (highest/high/medium/low/none), date picker with keyboard shortcuts (t=today, m=tomorrow, w=next Monday), dedicated `Tasks.md` storage, source file badges showing which note each task comes from, cross-vault task scanning from all files
- **Blog publisher** — publish notes directly to Medium (draft/public/unlisted with frontmatter tag extraction) or GitHub (push Markdown to any repo and branch with SHA-based updates)
- **Breadcrumb navigation** — folder-path breadcrumb bar above the editor showing `vault > folder > subfolder > note`, with left-truncation for deep paths
- **User-defined templates** — drop `.md` files into your vault's `templates/` folder and they appear alongside built-in templates in the template picker
- **Status bar task counter** — yellow badge showing number of tasks due today or overdue
- **Ctrl+K shortcut** — opens the task manager from any context
- **Custom diagram engine** — 6 diagram types rendered in view mode: sequence (combos/flows), tree (decisions), movement (footwork grids), timeline, comparison tables, and figure (10 pre-drawn fighting technique illustrations with colored body parts and key points)
- **Global search & replace** — find and replace text across all vault files with live preview, replace one (Ctrl+R), replace in file (Ctrl+F), or replace all (Ctrl+A)
- **AI template generator** — 9 template types (meeting notes, project plan, technical doc, blog post, tutorial, comparison, book summary, training plan, custom) with AI generation via Ollama/OpenAI or local fallback, topic input, live preview, and one-click note creation
- **Enhanced research agent** — 3 new Claude Code modes: Vault Analyzer (structure/gap analysis), Note Enhancer (improve current note with links and depth), Daily Digest (weekly review from recent vault activity); Deep Dive now has 4 research profiles (general/academic/technical/creative) and 4 source filters (any/web/docs/papers) with research log tracking
- **Language learning** — vocabulary tracker with 9 languages, spaced repetition practice mode, grammar notes with templates, progress dashboard with streak tracking and level distribution charts; stores everything in `Languages/` folder as markdown
- **Habit and goal tracker** — daily habit checkboxes with 7-day streak visualization, goal setting with milestones and progress bars, stats dashboard with completion rates and charts; stores in `Habits/` folder as markdown

### Changed

- Task manager now stores tasks in a dedicated `Tasks.md` file instead of the active note
- Task manager scans all vault files for tasks (Obsidian emoji format)
- Command palette entry added for blog publisher

### Fixed

- Task add not persisting when Today view filtered out new tasks without due dates
- Task toggle/date/priority changes not saving (consumed-once pattern eliminated)
- Task manager now uses direct file I/O instead of signaling through app.go
