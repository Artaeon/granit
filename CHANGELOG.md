## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Task manager rewrite** — 6 views (Today, Upcoming, All, Done, Calendar, Kanban board), 5 priority levels (highest/high/medium/low/none), date picker with keyboard shortcuts (t=today, m=tomorrow, w=next Monday), dedicated `Tasks.md` storage, source file badges showing which note each task comes from, cross-vault task scanning from all files
- **Blog publisher** — publish notes directly to Medium (draft/public/unlisted with frontmatter tag extraction) or GitHub (push Markdown to any repo and branch with SHA-based updates)
- **Breadcrumb navigation** — folder-path breadcrumb bar above the editor showing `vault > folder > subfolder > note`, with left-truncation for deep paths
- **User-defined templates** — drop `.md` files into your vault's `templates/` folder and they appear alongside built-in templates in the template picker
- **Status bar task counter** — yellow badge showing number of tasks due today or overdue
- **Ctrl+K shortcut** — opens the task manager from any context
- AI-powered features: ghost writer, AI chat, bots, and auto-tag suggestions
- Markdown editor with syntax highlighting and vim mode support
- Vault selector and splash screen for quick project switching
- Calendar view and graph view for visual note organization
- Git integration for version control, export functionality, and plugin system
- Slash command menu for fast in-editor actions
- 28 built-in themes and a command palette for quick navigation
- Pomodoro timer, flashcards, and quiz mode for productivity and learning
- Mermaid diagram rendering (flowcharts, sequence, pie, class, Gantt charts)

- Note encryption (AES-256-GCM) for secure GitHub sync
- Deep Dive research agent via Claude Code

### Changed

- Task manager now stores tasks in a dedicated `Tasks.md` file instead of the active note
- Task manager scans all vault files for tasks (Obsidian emoji format)
- Command palette entry added for blog publisher

### Fixed
